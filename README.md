# WeatherApp
A simple Angular weather app is a web application built using the Angular framework that allows users to check the weather forecast for a specific location. The app utilizes a weather API to retrieve real-time weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.3.

Key Features:

Location Search: Users can input the name of a city or location to retrieve the weather forecast for that specific area.
Current Weather Display: The app displays the current weather conditions for the selected location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

## Technical Implementation:
Angular Framework: The app is built using Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.
Weather API Integration: The app integrates with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API, AccuWeather API) to fetch weather data for the specified location.
HTTP Requests: Angular's HttpClient module is used to make HTTP requests to the weather API endpoints to retrieve weather data.
Component-Based Architecture: The app is structured using Angular components, including a search component, current weather component, forecast component, and error component.
Routing: Angular's routing module is used to navigate between different views of the app, such as the home page, search page, and weather details page.
Styling: The app's user interface is styled using CSS or a CSS preprocessor (e.g., Sass) to create a visually appealing and intuitive user experience.
Overall, the simple Angular weather app provides users with a convenient way to check the weather forecast for any location, making it easy to plan their activities and stay informed about current weather conditions.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
